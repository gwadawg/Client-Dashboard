/**
 * Launch Kit — 03 Week 1 operator checklist, one page per variant.
 *
 * Product x dial-owner matrix:
 *   rm/client    — LO / VA works leads (Wm-os template: Reverse mortgage appendix)
 *   rm/waiz      — Waiz call center dials + books; LO takes the appointment
 *   dscr/client  — LO / VA works every lead; drip is the safety net (Wm-os: DSCR self-serve)
 *   dscr/waiz    — Laura owns SMS + booking; LO owns the consult (Wm-os: DSCR Laura)
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: Wm-os docs/templates/client-launch-kit-template.md — "Product appendix — Week 1"
 * and the sample content.json (rm/client is ported 1:1; the other three follow its shape).
